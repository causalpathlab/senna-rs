//! `{prefix}.pb_reference.zarr.zip` — a run's pseudobulks, carried forward so the
//! next `senna update` does not have to re-read the cells they came from.
//!
//! **Why a backend and not a serialized statistic.** Every family trains only
//! on pseudobulks, so the pseudobulks *are* the training set. Written as an
//! ordinary sparse backend they can simply be handed back to the loader
//! alongside the new data, and the whole existing pipeline — projection, PB
//! partitioning, cross-batch matching, `optimize` — runs over the union with no
//! new estimator and no second code path. Carrying them as a `CollapsedStat`
//! blob would instead need bespoke append, merge and re-fit logic.
//!
//! **What is stored.** One column per finest-level pseudobulk, holding the
//! **batch-adjusted per-cell evidence rate** — `sum/denom` with no prior in
//! either, from `mu_adjusted` (falling back to `mu_observed` when a run had no
//! batch structure), zero wherever the posterior has no data support. Columns
//! a run itself carried in are the exception: the collapse keeps each in its
//! own singleton finest group and [`write`] re-emits it from `mu_observed` —
//! its stored, already-adjusted values back out — so the reference is
//! **append-only**: it extends by the new data's groups each round and never
//! re-averages what earlier rounds summarized. Three consequences:
//!
//! - It is a *rate*, so a carried column is directly comparable with a real
//!   cell — which is what makes the cross-batch matching, itself already in
//!   rate space, treat them alike.
//! - It is *adjusted*, so the batch correction this run computed is baked into
//!   the values. The next round anchors on it (see
//!   `MultilevelParams::anchor_batches`): new batches are corrected toward
//!   this frame, and the frame itself is never re-adjusted.
//! - Paired with the sidecar's cell counts it is a **bijection of the
//!   sufficient statistics** `(observed_sum, size)`: the next round's collapse
//!   reconstructs them exactly through the weighted-column path, so carrying
//!   pseudobulks forward is lossless at the finest level.
//!
//! The sidecar carries each column's cell count, which becomes its
//! [multiplicity](data_beans::sparse_io_vector::SparseIoVec::register_column_multiplicity)
//! on the way back in — without it a pseudobulk of 200 cells would weigh the
//! same as one cell.
