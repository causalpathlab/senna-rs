//! The shared driver behind `senna bge` and `senna gem`: everything from the
//! multilevel pseudobulk fit through the output writers and the run
//! manifest. `senna bge`'s own `fit_bge` (`bge/mod.rs`) resolves the
//! multiome layout, loads the data, and computes its HVG weights, then hands
//! off to [`fit_embed_family`] here; `senna gem` (`gem/run.rs`) does its own
//! (simpler) load and HVG pooling and hands off the same way. bge always
//! passes `EmbedPlan::tracks = None` (one track, every row its own gene);
//! gem passes its own row-grammar [`crate::gem::tracks::TrackPlan`], and
//! hooks its `{out}.feature_contrast.parquet` writer in through
//! [`EmbedPlan::after_fit`].
//!
//! [`EmbedKnobs`] is the flag surface both commands drive the fit with.
//! `GemArgs` now flattens the exact same `refine_weighting::CollapseArgs`
//! and `ge::FeatureModuleArgs` groups `BgeArgs` does (Task 5a), so both
//! `collapse` and `modules` are shared-by-reference fields here, as the
//! original sketch had them, and `build_config` reads the raw collapse
//! numbers (`num_levels`, `sort_dim`, `knn_cells`, `iter_opt`, `proj_dim`)
//! straight off whichever command's `collapse` this is — no more per-field
//! renaming. `bulk_batches` / `emit_pb_reference` / `refine` stay separate,
//! resolved fields: gem does not (yet) apply the carried-pb-reference /
//! mixture-batch policy those three encode (`GemArgs` has no
//! `pb_reference` / `init_from` surface and does not implement
//! `Updatable`), even though the shared struct's own flags now parse on
//! gem's surface too — so `GemArgs::knobs` still hardcodes them off, exactly
//! as before this task.
