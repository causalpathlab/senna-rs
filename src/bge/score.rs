//! Score cells against a frozen `senna bge` (or `senna simba`) gene embedding.
//!
//! Not the counterpart of [`crate::topic::masked_artifact`], despite both being "how you open
//! a model": that module *declares which files must exist* and validates them, because a
//! masked model is a checkpoint plus six parquets that several writers can drift apart. A bge
//! run has no checkpoint at all (`has_model: false`), so there is nothing to declare — the
//! whole model on the gene side is `(ρ, b_feat)`, and the only real work is finding them and
//! then scoring against them. Hence a scorer, in the bge module, rather than an artifact
//! declaration at the crate root.
//!
//! **ρ lives in more than one place, and only one resolver knows the rules.**
//! [`senna::run_manifest::resolve_feature_embedding_for`] exists because three consumers each
//! probed for ρ independently and each broke differently. Go through it. Note it returns
//! `(ρ_path, bias_path)` and `deconvolve` discards the second — a probe needs both, since
//! `(ρ, b_feat)` is exactly the frozen side that [`FrozenProjector`] and
//! [`graph_embedding_util::loss::multinomial_ll`] consume.
//!
//! `--skip-etm` is **not** required. It used to be, before the ρ slot always
//! carried raw signed ρ; it now does on both paths, which is why `deconvolve` documents
//! itself as working with or without the flag.
