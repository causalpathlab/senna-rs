//! `BgeEmbedding::open`'s gem-only additions: the row axis becomes a
//! `TrackPlan`, and the manifest's `track_encoders` slots resolve to numeric
//! track ids by matching their recorded name against that RE-DERIVED plan,
//! never a stored id (which could drift if the axis's own track order ever
//! changed).
//!
//! Runs a real, tiny gem fit rather than hand-building parquet files, so the
//! fixture tracks the real writer's schema instead of a hand-typed guess at
//! it. `QueryProjector::Tracks::place` itself (the actual encode_edges +
//! polish path) is covered by `predict::tests`'s end-to-end gem test; what is
//! specific to `open` and worth its own unit coverage is the path-resolution
//! step tested here.
