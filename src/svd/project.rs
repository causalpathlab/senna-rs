//! Query-side projection onto a frozen `senna svd` dictionary.
//!
//! An svd run writes no encoder checkpoint, so `predict` and `impute` cannot
//! reach it the way they reach the topic families. What it does write is the
//! dictionary `u` — orthonormal columns from the Nyström rsvd — and that is
//! enough: a new cell is put through the same per-column transform training
//! used ([`super::nystrom_preprocess_columns`]) and multiplied through `u`.
//!
//! **This is `u`, not the whitened basis `u·diag(1/s)` training projected
//! with.** The singular values are not persisted, so the scores here differ
//! from `{model}.latent.parquet` by a per-component scale. That is harmless
//! as long as everything being compared goes through THIS function — which is
//! why both consumers do, and why `impute` re-projects its reference rather
//! than reading the stored latent.
