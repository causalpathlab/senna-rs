//! Unified prediction subcommand for the dense and masked topic models.
//!
//! Loads a model trained by `senna topic` / `masked-topic`, applies it
//! to a held-out backend file, and writes:
//!   - `{out}.latent.parquet`     [N × K] log θ (per-cell topic proportions)
//!   - `{out}.predictive.parquet` [N × 3] per-cell `[llik, total, llik_per_count]`
//!
//! Three latent-inference modes (mutually exclusive):
//!   - `Encoder` (default): forward pass through the trained encoder only.
//!   - `EncoderRefine` (`--refine-steps > 0`): encoder warm-start, then
//!     decoder gradient on θ anchored to encoder by L2.
//!   - `DecoderOnly` (`--decoder-only`): skip encoder; init θ uniform
//!     `log(1/K)`; optimize purely against the frozen decoder. Useful when
//!     the test feature set is too divergent for the encoder.
