//! Reproduce a multiome run's data load from its run manifest.
//!
//! A multiome fit changes the load in three ways: cells glue by barcode
//! (`ColumnAlignment::Union`), features are namespaced `{name}/{modality}`,
//! and — with several sample groups — barcodes are namespaced
//! `{barcode}@{group}`. None of that was recorded, so every `--from` consumer
//! re-read the files the plain way and matched nothing: the cells came back
//! doubled and unnamespaced, and the feature names no longer matched the
//! dictionary they were supposed to project onto.
//!
//! Two directions, because `--from` consumers do two different things:
//!
//! - **The run's own files** replay [`RunMultiome`] straight out of the
//!   manifest. It is positional against `data.input`, which the trainer wrote
//!   in group order.
//! - **A query file set** is new data, so its layout is *detected* the same
//!   way training detected its own. Detection names modalities after the
//!   query's filenames, which need not match the training run's, so the tags
//!   are then renamed by which trained row block the features actually land
//!   in ([`reconcile_modalities`]).
