//! Dense bulk tables as `predict` inputs.
//!
//! Everything downstream of `predict_model` streams a `SparseIoVec` in blocks:
//! `read_columns_csc`, the δ estimate, the minibatch loops, bge's projection.
//! Rather than fork those five paths for a dense matrix, a `--bulk` table is
//! materialized ONCE into a throwaway sparse backend and handed down as a
//! path, so no scoring code knows which door the data came in through. The
//! equivalence with a backend built the long way (`data-beans from-mtx`) is
//! pinned in `bulk_tests.rs`.
//!
//! The table is kept on its OWN gene axis. Alignment to the model — and with
//! it `--feature-name-kind`, `--ablate-features` and the coverage gate —
//! happens in `build_remap`, as for every other input. The model's genes are
//! consulted here only to decide which axis of the table is the gene axis.
