//! Continuing a model onto a gene axis the source run did not have.
//!
//! A checkpoint's gene-keyed state is small: the fine-to-coarse map of each
//! coarsening level, and whichever tensors are keyed by gene rather than by
//! coarse group, module or topic. A cohort that measures genes the source run never saw can
//! still be absorbed if those are carried by NAME rather than refused by
//! position. Every family with a checkpoint goes through here. The pieces live
//! where their mechanism does:
//!
//! - the alignment of this run's names onto the source run's is the same
//!   matcher `predict` aligns a query with ([`remap_for_init_from`]);
//! - a coarsening level is grown by `FeatureCoarsening::grow_by_profile`, each
//!   unknown gene joining the inherited coarse group whose known members its
//!   pseudobulk profile most resembles (see `inherit_level_coarsenings`);
//! - the checkpoint's gene-keyed tensors are gathered onto the new order by
//!   `legume_numeric::candle::grow`, which starts an unseen gene at the checkpoint's mean;
//! - a free per-gene ρ knows more than that, so [`refine_rho_by_coarsening`]
//!   moves an unseen gene's row from the global mean to the mean of its coarse
//!   group's known members. A feature side composed from learned modules takes
//!   neither: its membership starts flat, the one start that leaves every
//!   module reachable (see `legume_numeric::candle::grow`). The families with no per-gene
//!   embedding at all take only the gather.
