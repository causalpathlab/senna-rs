//! Observed-vs-predicted agreement on held-out cells, on both axes.
//!
//! `predictive.parquet`'s log-likelihood answers "how probable are this cell's
//! counts under the model". A correlation answers a different and often more
//! legible question — "does the model rank this cell's genes the way the data
//! does" — and it is the one a benchmark table usually reports.
//!
//! # Two axes, because they are different questions
//!
//! - **Per cell, across genes.** One number per test cell: does the model get
//!   the *shape* of this cell's profile right? Averaged, it is a per-cell fit.
//! - **Per gene, across cells.** One number per gene: does the model track this
//!   gene's variation *between* cells? This is the harder one and the one that
//!   collapses first — a model can reproduce every cell's overall profile while
//!   carrying no information about which cells differ.
//!
//! A method can look strong on the first and be dead on the second, so both are
//! reported rather than one standing in for the other.
//!
//! # Why the evaluation gene set is fixed by the caller
//!
//! Scoring happens on each model's own gene axis, so a model trained on 80% of
//! the genes is otherwise scored over fewer — and, on average, better-expressed
//! — genes than a model trained on all of them, and the two numbers are not
//! comparable. `--eval-features` pins one gene set for every method, whatever
//! each happens to carry, which is what makes an ablation series readable.
