//! Pooled gene-level HVG projection weights for `senna gem`.
//!
//! Unlike a plain row axis, a gem gene may carry several rows (one per
//! track: the base count, an unspliced offset, one pair of channel rows per
//! co-measured modality). HVG selection has to rank GENES, pooling every one
//! of a gene's rows first — otherwise a gene whose variance shows up only in
//! a modality track (never in its own counts) would never earn its
//! projection weight. [`gem_hvg_row_weights`] does that pooling over a
//! [`TrackPlan`] and hands back a per-ROW weight vector, 1.0 only on the
//! BASE row (`count/spliced`) of a selected gene — every other row of that
//! gene, on every other track, carries weight 0. Non-base rows never carry
//! projection weight regardless of selection: the hierarchical trainer
//! already restricts its random-projection sketch to base rows when
//! `n_tracks > 1` (a masked clone of the feature axis), so this is the belt
//! to that suspender, not a second, independent decision.

/// Per-row HVG projection weights over a gem feature axis, pooled per gene
/// across every track. `None` when selection is off and the axis has only
/// the base track (plain `senna bge` behaviour: no weighting at all).
///
/// - `--feature-list-file` REPLACES the ranking with exactly the named
///   genes, resolved against `plan.gene_names` (lenient matching, see
///   [`MustTrainFeatures::resolve_with`]).
/// - Otherwise, when `hvg.n_hvg > 0`, genes are ranked by NB dispersion-trend
///   excess over pooled per-gene `(mean, variance)`: every row's streaming
///   stats are computed once, then summed into `plan.row_gene` buckets, so a
///   gene's base, unspliced and modality rows all contribute to its rank.
/// - `--must-train-features` UNIONS a curated panel into the selection,
///   resolved the same way, regardless of which of the two rules produced
///   the base selection.
/// - Weights: `w[r] = 1.0` iff `plan.base_rows[r]` and `row_gene[r]` was
///   selected, else `0.0` — computed over ALL selected genes, `Some` even
///   when nothing was selected (an all-zero vector), so the caller never has
///   to re-derive "selection ran but kept nothing" from a `None`.
/// - Selection off (`n_hvg == 0` and no `--feature-list-file`): `Some` of
///   the base-row mask when the plan has more than the base track (so
///   modality/unspliced rows still get weight 0, matching what the trainer
///   restricts to anyway), else `None` — a plain spliced-only axis has
///   nothing to mask, matching `senna bge`'s own unweighted default.
