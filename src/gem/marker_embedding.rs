//! Loading a run's co-embedded **gene** table for marker matching — the
//! per-run `{out}.feature_embedding.parquet` slot on the run manifest.
//!
//! A `gem` run's feature axis is keyed by feature ROW, not by gene: a spliced
//! and an unspliced row per gene. A marker panel names genes, so matching it
//! against the raw table would silently pull both rows into the same
//! centroid, averaging the mature identity together with the nascent one.
//! [`select_spliced_rows`] keeps the mature (spliced) rows and strips the
//! track suffix back to the gene key, which is what the marker matcher
//! expects. Every other kind's feature embedding is already gene-keyed and
//! needs no such split.
