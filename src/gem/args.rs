//! `senna gem`'s command-line surface: the [`GemArgs`] clap struct.
//!
//! Mirrors `senna/src/bge/args.rs` field for field: the same shared groups
//! (`HvgCliArgs`, `refine_weighting::CollapseArgs`, `QcArgs`,
//! `ge::FeatureModuleArgs`), the same top-level knobs, and the same help text
//! for every flag they share, so `senna bge` and `senna gem` read as one
//! flag surface, including the `--{freeze,init,lora}-feature-embedding`
//! triple. gem adds its own modality inputs (`GENES...`, `--modality`,
//! `--genes-sample-strip`) and its own knobs on the per-track feature
//! offsets: their rank (`--offset-rank`) and ridge (`--offset-l2`). Unlike
//! `BgeArgs`, `GemArgs` does not implement `Updatable`; `senna update` does
//! not (yet) continue a gem run.
