//! `senna update` — absorb new samples into a trained model by continuing its
//! training, rather than refitting the cohort from scratch.
//!
//! **This is a dispatcher, not a trainer.** It reconstructs the parent's own
//! fit call — recorded in its manifest as [`senna::run_manifest::TrainArgsRecord`]
//! — points it at `recorded ∪ new` data, turns on warm start, and hands the
//! whole thing to the unchanged family entry point. No new estimator, no second
//! training path to keep in sync with the first.
//!
//! **Why that is enough.** Every family already trains purely on pseudobulks:
//! `train_mixed` and `train_masked` consume only `&[CollapsedOut]`, and `svd`
//! runs `rsvd` on the pseudobulk posterior. Re-running the fit over the union
//! therefore gives PB-level retraining, *exact* cell-level replay of the old
//! cohort, and a batch adjustment where old and new cells are matched at **cell**
//! resolution by `collect_matched_stat_visitor` — stronger than anything that
//! works from stored pseudobulk summaries.
//!
//! What that costs is time: re-reading every previously absorbed cell makes a
//! chain of S samples O(S²) in cell reads. So by default a round substitutes the
//! parent's carried pseudobulks for its cells ([`senna::pb_reference`]) and
//! costs the new data only; the exact re-collapse remains the baseline it is
//! checked against (`--no-pb-reference`), and the fallback when the
//! substitution is impossible — see [`select_reference`].
//!
//! **The partition is deliberately not inherited.** `--from` would pull the
//! parent's cell→pb membership along with its inputs, but
//! `align_cell_to_pb_to_cells` bails on any cell absent from the source — which
//! every new cell is. `from` is forced to `None`.
