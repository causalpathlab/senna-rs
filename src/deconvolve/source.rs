//! Resolve the gene axis and the archetype inputs from an upstream run manifest.
//!
//! **`senna bge` (with or without `--skip-etm`) and `senna simba` are the
//! supported sources.** What is taken from a run:
//!
//! - the gene axis and embedding width, from `feature_embedding.parquet` — the
//!   per-gene loading ρ. Older runs kept ρ only under `--skip-etm`, where it
//!   borrowed the `dictionary` slot, so that legacy layout is read as a
//!   fallback. There the slot must be checked by CONTENT (a β has
//!   gene-log-simplex columns), never by which cell-side slots are populated,
//!   since `latent` and `cell_embedding` are interchangeable and have swapped
//!   roles between versions.
//! - the cell embedding, which the archetypes are clustered in.
//! - the input counts and the cell annotation, which the profiles are built from.
//!
//! Only ρ's row names and width are retained — the reference is measured from
//! the counts rather than reconstructed — but its values are still scale-checked,
//! so a manifest pointing at a topic dictionary is caught rather than silently
//! supplying the wrong gene axis.
//!
//! Topic-family runs are rejected up front; see [`EmbeddingSource::load`].
