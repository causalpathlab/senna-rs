//! Empirical NB-Fisher-weighted gene × topic dictionary for downstream
//! annotation.
//!
//! The feature-coarsened β from topic training lives at a reduced resolution
//! (~1k coarse features) and is expanded back to full gene resolution via
//! `expand_log_dict_dk`, which spreads each coarse feature's loading across its
//! constituent genes proportional to the training-time sufficient statistics.
//! That expansion is a lossy approximation — rare informative genes (e.g.
//! hemoglobins for erythroid cells) can get merged into generic coarse features
//! and lose lineage-specific contrast at reporting time.
//!
//! This module computes an alternative *empirical* β at full gene resolution:
//!
//!     β_emp[g, k] = NB_fisher_weight[g] · Σ_p pb_gene[g, p] · pb_theta[p, k]
//!
//! then column-normalizes to the probability simplex. The NB Fisher-info
//! weight is computed via the shared
//! `data_beans::alg::gene_weighting::compute_nb_fisher_weights` (same formula
//! used during DC-Poisson refinement, kept consistent across pinto / senna /
//! chickpea reporting). This is the dictionary `senna annotate-by-enrichment` consumes.
