//! Counterfactual axes **benefit** / **forgetting** for `senna probe --counterfactual`.
//!
//! `probe`'s default score is the potential outcome `Y(0)` — does the frozen model
//! explain these cells. This module estimates the **effect of updating on them**, to
//! first order:
//!
//! ```text
//!   g  = ∇ℓ(Q_fit) − ∇ℓ(C_ctrl)          the contrast direction   [K,H]
//!
//!   benefit    =  ⟨ ∇ℓ(Q_eval), g ⟩       efficacy  (> 0 ⇒ the batch teaches)
//!   forgetting = −⟨ ∇ℓ(C_eval), g ⟩       toxicity  (> 0 ⇒ the batch damages)
//! ```
//!
//! These are the first-order terms of a refit: `ℓ(eval; α + η∇ℓ(fit)) − ℓ(eval; α₀)`
//! expands to `η⟨∇ℓ(eval), ∇ℓ(fit)⟩`, and differencing treatment against control leaves
//! `η⟨∇ℓ(eval), g⟩`. The step size `η` is a common scale, so it is dropped — it cancels in
//! every comparison between datasets. **Do not normalize `g`**; see below.
//!
//! Read it as: *step `α` in the direction this batch pulls, rather than where ordinary
//! reference data pulls; how does held-out fit move on each side?* `forgetting` is negated
//! so "larger is worse" on both axes; the price is that the size-weighted net gain
//! **subtracts** — `n_query · benefit − n_reference · forgetting` — so the minus sign
//! lives here and nowhere else.
//!
//! The `forgetting` axis is the reason this module exists. A goodness-of-fit score cannot
//! see it: a contaminated but in-distribution batch reconstructs perfectly and still drags
//! the dictionary off.
//!
//! **The control arm is enacted, not subtracted.** Even a null batch improves fit when you
//! train on it, so the estimand is *"the effect of adding **this** batch rather than
//! ordinary in-distribution data"*. That is the `− ∇ℓ(C_ctrl)` term, and dropping it would
//! measure "does training help at all", which is always yes.
//!
//! **`forgetting > 0` does not mean "refuse".** A batch carrying a topic the model
//! lacks *must* distort the existing ones to make room, so genuine novelty and genuine
//! contamination both forget — they are not separable on this axis alone. Nor is
//! forgetting unconditionally a cost: knowledge is worth protecting in proportion to how
//! likely it is to be needed again, which is a property of the dataset stream and is not
//! observable from one probe call.
//!
//! **Intervention (stated, not implied).** The encoder is frozen, so cell representations
//! `θ_j` are fixed and only the dictionary `α` moves. This is "update the dictionary", not
//! a joint retrain — a real one would also move the encoder, hence `θ`.
//!
//! **Scale and direction are reported separately, because they answer different
//! questions.** `‖g‖` is *how hard* this batch pulls; the two cosines are *where*. Both
//! effects are projections of the same `g`, so they are **correlated by construction** —
//! a merely divergent dataset inflates `‖g‖` and hence both at once. Coupled benefit and
//! forgetting is geometry, never evidence about the data.
//!
//! ⚠️ **Never divide the effects by `‖g‖`.** It looks like a harmless standardization and
//! it inverts the null: a query drawn from the reference has `g ≈ 0` — pure sampling noise
//! — and rescaling that to unit length collides it with the parent's own misfit direction,
//! which is large because the parent is not a stationary point of the scored objective. An
//! in-distribution arm then outscores one carrying a held-out cell type. The cosines exist
//! to carry the scale-free reading without contaminating the effects.
//!
//! Direction and evaluation use disjoint cells, so neither effect carries in-sample
//! optimism, and roles come from a **seeded shuffle**, not file position — see `splits`.
//!
//! # ❌ Do not reintroduce the refit (removed 2026-08-07)
//!
//! Earlier versions ran two 100-step full-batch AdamW refits of `α` — treatment on
//! `C_base ∪ Q_fit`, control on `C_base ∪ C₂` — and differenced held-out fit. That put
//! `--cf-steps`, `--cf-lr` and an inherited `weight_decay: 0.01` **inside the estimand**:
//! "the effect of absorbing this dataset" silently meant "under this optimizer
//! configuration", and no two runs at different settings were comparable.
//!
//! The first-order effect needs none of that — no step count, no learning rate, no
//! shrinkage prior, and no stationarity assumption either. **That last point is what
//! distinguishes this from the deleted influence screen** (`influence.rs`, 0.8.6): that one
//! needed `H⁻¹` and a quadratic approximation around a mode, which the parent's non-zero
//! training gradient invalidated. A directional derivative is valid wherever it is taken.
//!
//! What the refit could see and this cannot: **higher-order terms**. Over many steps topics
//! can reorganize in ways no derivative at the parent predicts. If that turns out to
//! matter, report the curvature along `g` — do not restore a procedure whose
//! hyperparameters are indistinguishable from its findings.
//!
//! # ❌ Do not reintroduce the label-permutation null (removed 2026-08-07)
//!
//! Earlier versions permuted the treatment/control label over the pooled fit cells
//! `Q_fit ∪ C₂` and reported upper-tail p-values. The test was *valid* and it was
//! *useless*, for a structural reason:
//!
//! `Q_eval` is pure query and fixed across permutations. Under a permuted split each arm
//! receives about half of `Q_fit`, so both refits explain `Q_eval` about equally well and
//! the permuted `benefit` sits near zero. The observed arrangement — all query cells in
//! treatment, none in control — is the extreme point of the arrangement space by
//! construction. The same argument applies to `forgetting` with `C_eval`.
//!
//! So the sharp null being tested was *"the query cells are exchangeable with reference
//! cells"* — i.e. the new dataset is drawn from the reference distribution. That is false
//! for every dataset anyone would probe, so the test had near-total power against it and
//! `p` collapsed to the `1/(N+1)` floor mechanically, identically for arms differing in
//! biology, in platform, and in both. Only a query genuinely drawn from the reference
//! failed to reject — the consistency check confirming the diagnosis, not a defence.
//!
//! A p-value that fires on any distributional difference answers the fit score's question,
//! not this module's. **The effect sizes carry the information; the p-values did not.**
//! What would supply a real scale is a *reference* arm — the same contrast with a held-out
//! slice of the reference playing the query role — which is how the fit score is already
//! calibrated. Until that lands, this module reports magnitudes and no verdict.
