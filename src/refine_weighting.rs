//! Shared CLI args for the upstream projection + multilevel pseudobulk
//! collapse pipeline, plus inference-time amortization refinement.
//!
//! - [`CollapseArgs`] bundles every knob of the shared random-projection +
//!   multilevel-collapse pipeline (`--proj-dim`, `--sort-dim`, `--knn-cells`,
//!   `--num-levels`, `--iter-opt`, `--ignore-batch`) and flattens
//!   [`PbRefineArgs`] inside it. Flatten it into any subcommand that runs
//!   that pipeline so the flag surface stays identical across `senna topic`,
//!   `masked-topic`, `joint-topic`, `svd`, `svd joint`, and `gbe`.
//!
//! Two distinct things share the word "refinement", so the CLI keeps them on
//! separate prefixes:
//!
//! - `--pb-refine-*` flags drive [`data_beans::alg::refine_multilevel::RefineParams`]
//!   used during hierarchical pseudobulk collapsing.
//! - `--amort-refine-*` flags drive
//!   [`legume_numeric::candle::topic_refinement::TopicRefinementConfig`] used at
//!   inference to fine-tune per-cell topic logits against the frozen decoder.
