//! Run manifest — the single JSON artifact that ties a senna run
//! together across subcommands.
//!
//! Shape: `senna topic` / `masked-topic` / `joint-topic` write a fresh
//! manifest at the end of training. `senna layout` reads it, produces 2D
//! coords, and updates the `layout{}` section in place. `senna plot` (and
//! future postprocess commands) read the fully-enriched manifest and
//! work with zero further flags. CLI flags on those commands stay
//! available and win over manifest values when both are supplied.
//!
//! The schema is deliberately narrow — data paths + output artifact
//! paths + a couple of UI defaults. It is a run descriptor, not a config
//! language, and nothing here should grow into one.
//!
//! The one exception is [`RunManifest::train_args`], added for `senna update`,
//! which continues a run's training and therefore needs the parent's exact fit
//! configuration to reproduce its architecture. It is stored as an **opaque**
//! [`serde_json::Value`] precisely to preserve the rule above: no command other
//! than `update` parses it, so the manifest stays readable by every version
//! regardless of which flags a fit command has gained. Shell history and
//! Makefiles remain the answer for re-running by hand.
//!
//! All path values are resolved relative to the manifest file's own
//! directory, so a run directory can be moved or copied without
//! breaking downstream reads.
//!
//! # Output conventions: axis, and SCALE
//!
//! A slot name fixes the axis and shape. It does **not** fix the numeric scale,
//! and scale is where the bugs live — signed vs log-simplex vs probability-simplex
//! all look alike in a `D × K` float table, so a misread produces `NaN` or a
//! degenerate model with no shape mismatch to catch it. Classify with
//! [`ArtifactScale::detect`], or assert with [`ArtifactScale::ensure`].
//!
//! | slot | shape | scale | holds |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `latent` | N × K | log-simplex ROWS (topic) / signed (SVD, masked-vae) | per-cell `log θ` or component scores — gate on [`RunKind::latent_is_log_simplex`] |
//! | `cell_embedding` | N × H | signed | per-cell embedding `Z` |
//! | `feature_embedding` | D × H | signed | per-gene embedding `ρ` — MULTIPLIES `Z` in the log-rate `ρ_g·z_n + a_g + b_n` |
//! | `feature_coembedding` | D × H | signed | where each gene SITS, re-projected onto the cell manifold (SIMBA co-embed) |
//! | `softmax_dictionary` | D × K | **log**-simplex COLUMNS | topic dictionary `β` — `Σ_g exp(β[g,k]) = 1` |
//! | `dictionary` | D × K | signed | SVD component loadings; also where pre-split manifests land. ⚠ legacy `bge --skip-etm` puts ρ here |
//! | `dictionary_empirical` | D × K | probability-simplex COLUMNS | empirical `β`, full gene resolution |
//! | `topic_embedding` | K × H | signed | per-topic embedding `α` |
//! | `feature_bias` / `cell_bias` | D / N | signed (log-scale offsets) | `a_g` / `b_n` |
//!
//! Read a dictionary through [`RunOutputs::gene_dictionary`] when either form
//! will do; branch on `kind` (or detect) when the scale matters.
//!
//! `feature_embedding` and `feature_coembedding` are NOT interchangeable: the
//! co-embed is a lossy derived view of ρ (a convex combination of cell
//! embeddings), so ρ → co-embed is one-way. Before manifest v2 the embedding
//! commands wrote the co-embed AS `feature_embedding` and ρ as
//! `feature_loading`; [`RunManifest::load`] moves a v1 manifest's slots onto
//! the v2 names, so no reader sees the old layout.
//!
//! The slot still marked ⚠ is a historical overload that has caused a real
//! bug. It is read defensively (by content, not by which sibling slots are
//! populated) and is on the way out; write the unambiguous slot.
