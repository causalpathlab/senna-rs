# Plan — A text-anchored gene space: literature priors, a concept vocabulary, and grounded hypotheses for senna

*Working notes, 2026-09-15; revised 2026-09-16 after PR #60 (`gene-text`, typed `senna fne`, shared `--freeze/--init-feature-embedding`) merged. Status: design, no code. Branch `ypp/text-anchored-genes`. Builds on `annotation-ontology-plan.md` (the depth axis) and the deep-research report of the same day (108 agents, 26 primary sources, 23/25 claims verified). Sibling memory: `[[pretrained-llm-leverage-brainstorm]]`.*

## 0. Stance

Do not compete with single-cell foundation models; take the one asset they cannot supply and we cannot learn from one dataset — **gene identity grounded outside the data** — and let everything else stay as it is: sparse, likelihood-based, pseudobulk-first. The 2025–26 pattern we copy is the LLM world's: a small specialised model, frozen outside knowledge, retrieval, and tools. Nothing in this plan imports a backbone.

## 1. The problem

senna learns everything from the run in front of it. The axes that stay weak are exactly the ones shared across every dataset:

- **Gene side.** ρ on multiome scored AUC 0.44 against 0.65 for a clean run; gene-pair NCE and module priors did not move it. A dictionary learned from one dataset's co-variation is the low-sample object.
- **Annotation.** Per-cell confidence is flat (~0.2); `annotate-by-projection` was indistinguishable from a shuffled marker panel on BMMNC (panel-null p > 0.14 for 7/8 types); the empty-marker magnet and the panel-must-match pathology are both gene-side failures — markers the run never learned.
- **Batch / query placement.** The indexed encoder cannot batch-correct cleanly; a frozen reference embedding does not batch-correct at all.

## 2. What the evidence settled (do not re-litigate)

**Dead.** Importing a foundation-model backbone for embedding quality — simple baselines match or beat every scFM including after fine-tuning (Ahlmann-Eltze, Huber & Anders, *Nat Methods* 2025; VCBench, bioRxiv 10.64898/2026.06.18.733146; Han et al., bioRxiv 10.64898/2026.04.17.719314; Arc VCC 2025). Expression-FM gene tables (Geneformer, scGPT) as a ρ prior — beat the mean, not PCA from the training data (Ahlmann-Eltze). Scale — pretraining saturates near 200k cells (DenAdel et al., *Nat Methods* 2026). Dense-input models.

**Confirmed.** Retrieval over our own reference is the cell-side state of the art (VCBench; scTOP, arXiv 2602.16696 — a parameter-free projection onto a *pseudobulk basis*). Calibration comes from **agreement across heterogeneous annotators**, not from any single score (popV, *Nat Genet* 2024). A gene-table + MLP encoder suffices for atlas-scale retrieval annotation (SCimilarity, *Nature* 2025; DenAdel).

**Open, and ours to test.** LLM *text* embeddings of gene descriptions beat expression-learned gene embeddings on gene-function tasks (OMIM AUROC 0.88 vs scGPT 0.74; bioRxiv 10.1101/2025.01.29.635607), work as an *additive* prior on an expression dictionary rather than a replacement (scGenePT), need functional description text — bare symbols are near-random (GEbench, bioRxiv 10.64898/2026.04.30.721875) — and are anisotropic (cross-gene cosine 0.74–0.84; scELMo, *Patterns* 2026). Open-weight encoders beat the original API embeddings (bioRxiv 10.64898/2026.04.16.718976). **Nobody has tested a text prior inside a Poisson/topic model, and nobody benchmarks robustness to count noise or per-cell calibration.**

## 3. Core idea — genes are a bilingual dictionary

Two languages. In the expression language a cell is a sentence over genes and the model places it at `z_c ∈ ℝ^H`. In the text language every concept with a description — gene, Cell Ontology term, pathway, disease, state, transcription factor — has a vector `k ∈ ℝ^{H_text}` from one text encoder. **Genes exist in both**, so they are a parallel lexicon, and the map between the languages is fitted on them (the MUSE setup: Conneau et al., ICLR 2018 — Procrustes on a bilingual lexicon aligns whole vocabularies; CSLS corrects hubness).

The gene dictionary becomes, per gene `g`,

```
ρ_g = s_g · ( ρ₀_g + u_g · V ) + b_g        ρ₀: [D, H] frozen;  u_g ∈ ℝ^r,  V ∈ ℝ^{r×H},  r ≪ H
```

- `ρ₀` is the anchor: a `senna fne` table (GO + PPI + words, already at the model's H) or a text table `K_text · W₀` translated from `H_text` to `H` (`K_text` centred and whitened; `W₀` = PCA/Procrustes offline for the probe, the existing `FeatAdapter` when trained).
- `u_g · V` is a LoRA residual (Hu et al., 2021) — row-side `U: [D, r]` is gathered per gene like every other trained row (the sparse rule), `V: [r, H]` is dense and tiny. `r = 0` is "fully prior", `r = H` is "learn from scratch", so the experiment is a rank sweep. LoRA on a gene table has no precedent in single-cell; adapters on transformer backbones do (scPEFT, *Nat Mach Intell* 2025) and beat full fine-tuning on small or shifted data.
- **LoRA+** (Hayou, Ghosh & Yu, ICML 2024): same model, but the zero-initialised factor trains at λ× the other's learning rate (λ ≈ 2⁴ in the paper; λ = 1 is plain LoRA). Ours: `u_g ~ N(0, 1/r)`, `V = 0` at start, `lr(V) = λ · lr(U)`. The asymmetry is stronger here than in a transformer: a gene's `u_g` row moves only when the gene is in the batch, `V` moves every step.
- `diag(s)` and `b_g` are not optional: text tables carry no notion of abundance and a bilinear Poisson decoder needs per-gene magnitude (the DoRA magnitude/direction split, Liu et al., ICML 2024). bge already trains `b_g` under freeze; the masked models carry no `b_g` yet. `s_g` stays off until the probe asks for it.
- Unmatched genes (no row in the table) keep a **free** row in every mode; they are not dropped.

**The flags** — one shared struct, mutually exclusive, identical on `bge`, `masked-*`, `simba`, `fne`:

```
--freeze-feature-embedding <PREFIX>   pin ρ = ρ₀; biases train
--init-feature-embedding   <PREFIX>   start ρ at ρ₀, train it freely
--lora-feature-embedding   <PREFIX>   pin ρ₀, train ρ = ρ₀ + U·V
    --lora-rank <r>        default 16
    --lora-lr-ratio <λ>    LoRA+ ratio; default 4 (16 hurt under AdamW on sim), 1 = plain LoRA
```

Under `freeze` and `lora` the table's rows that match no feature of the run — genes the data lacks (a panel) and every non-gene row — are carried through unchanged into the run's ρ output after the trained rows, with `{out}.feature_types.parquet` naming each row's type, so a run on a narrow axis hands on the full table. `init` does not carry them: its trained rows leave the table's space. A carried row the run wrote itself (a term both graphs hold) is superseded by the run's own.

`senna gem` takes the same triple, read onto its row grammar: a bare gene name is the gene's `count/spliced` row (so a `bge` or `fne` table pins the spliced rows and every other track trains as an offset on them), and a `{gene}/{modality}/{channel}` name is that row (so an earlier `gem` table pins, or starts, the track offsets too, as `row − base row`). Every track's per-gene offset is itself LoRA-shaped, `δ_g = u_g · V` at `--offset-rank` (its own number, checked against H, never taken from it), so unspliced, and every co-measured modality, is a low-rank residual on the spliced row. A carried gene lands as `{gene}/count/spliced`; a carried term keeps its name.

`<PREFIX>` resolves as today (`{prefix}.feature_embedding.parquet`, else a signed `.dictionary`; gene rows only when `feature_types.parquet` is present; canonical-name match; `--embedding-dim auto` takes H from the table).

Once the map exists, every text concept can be translated into the model's space, including ones with no expression counterpart (a disease name), and every model object can be translated out (a topic β as an expression-weighted sum of gene text vectors — scELMo's weighted-average mode).

## 4. What it buys, by layer

### 4.1 Gene side (the direct claim)
Anchored genes cannot be dragged into a modality-dominated geometry — the CITE-seq ADT collapse on record (14 rows, 68 % of counts) is the first test. ADT rows take their target gene's text. Convergence: the itopic "SVD ρ-init" accelerator, with better content.

### 4.2 Annotation — depth × breadth
- **Breadth: the vocabulary.** A cluster is described by a *set* of scored concepts across axes — identity (`CD8⁺ T cell`), state (`exhaustion`), program (`interferon-α response`), context (`bone marrow`), TFs — where a tree could only give one path. Two directions: data → text (weighted sum of gene text vectors; no training) and text → model (`s_v = k_v W₀`, scored by the model's own bilinear rule, i.e. **concepts as pseudo-genes**).
- **Depth: ontology levels in bge phase 1.** Cell Ontology depths as additional pseudobulk partitions (label-pure pseudobulks per depth) alongside the unsupervised pb tree. ρ must explain composition at every granularity; the per-level pb embeddings *are* CL-term embeddings in the cell/gene space; annotation walks levels and **stops at a sibling tie** (the abstention rule of `annotation-ontology-plan.md`, now with a trained geometry); a held-out fine type retreats to its ancestor instead of being dropped. This is SCimilarity's one real ingredient — its labels live on the CL — taken without its dense input, label-triplet loss, or `1/distance` OOD threshold.
- **Predicted division of labour.** Text resolves lineage and is blind to siblings (CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T-cell descriptions are the same sentence); the expression-trained levels resolve siblings or abstain. The two cover each other's weakness.
- **`annotate-by-projection` revived.** It failed because it projected through a gene space that had not learned the markers. With anchored ρ, marker signatures are distinct from shuffled ones by construction, and the type-text route needs no panel at all — so the empty-marker magnet and panel-must-match cannot occur.

### 4.3 Multiome — regions as words with no text
Peaks have no description, but they share cells with anchored genes, so free peak rows settle next to the genes and concepts they co-vary with: a functional annotation of a region with no gene assigned by hand. Honest reading: co-placement is **program membership** (trans), not a cis link. The cis call belongs to chickpea (peak-to-gene + GhostKnockoff FDR); the anchored space supplies the *prior*. Optional partial anchor for peaks: motif content as a sentence of TF words, `k_peak = Σ_motifs k_TF`. Validation is expression-independent: CRISPRi enhancer–gene pairs (Fulco et al., *Nat Genet* 2019; Gasperini et al., *Cell* 2019; ENCODE-rE2G, Gschwind et al., bioRxiv 2023).

### 4.4 Hypothesis sentences — the last mile
Per cluster, the scored concept set with its abstentions is the evidence; a lightweight LLM **composes, never decides**. Structured JSON in; one or two sentences plus the list of concepts used out; a verifier rejects any sentence naming an entity outside the retrieved set (the RAG citation check). Abstentions are a required slot ("a T cell whose CD4/CD8 identity the data does not resolve"). What makes it a hypothesis rather than a caption is the proposed test — "*HAVCR2* and *LAG3* should be elevated relative to cluster 3" — which the tools can run. Local models (Qwen3-1.7B/4B-Instruct, Phi-4-mini via `candle-transformers`) are sufficient; the composer lives in `gene-text` beside the text encoder, never in senna. Prior art to position against: GPTCelltype (Hou & Ji, *Nat Methods* 2024) and scChat hand a marker list to GPT-4; CellWhisperer trains a CLIP-style captioner on paired data. Ours needs no pairs — genes are the pairs — and the composer is sandboxed.

## 5. Ruled out on the way (keep out)

- SCimilarity as a model or index: dense 28k-gene input, label-triplet metric learning with a 0.05 margin, robustness only to noise present in its training atlas, and drift handled by *dropping* cells. Its architecture class (gene table + pooling + MLP) is bge's phase-2 encoder trained on labels instead of on the pb tree; bge additionally has a count likelihood and depth augmentation by construction.
- Expression-FM gene tables in the prior bank; Geneformer backbone via candle (the only licence-clean one, recorded for completeness); Stack-style in-context cells (parked, +1.8 % margin); remote embedding APIs; Census-embedding joins (parked, undecided reference).

## 6. Objects and seams that already exist (post PR #60)

| Engine | Where ρ lives | Freeze today | LoRA hook |
|---|---|---|---|
| bge phase 1 (`graph-embedding-util/src/fit/hier/`) | candle `Var`s on `HierParams` (μ_m + r_g, biases, per-track offsets); the two-level softmax as gathers + one batched matmul per track + row log-softmax; one `backward()`; row-Adagrad with the bias sharing its row's accumulator | gradient masks (`0` on pinned rows, on all of μ), pinned rows kept verbatim for the output, biases train | two residuals of one rank: `μ + a·V_M` on the module dictionary (a module's genes move together) and `gather(r) + gather(u)·V_G` on the gene rows, both through `candle_util::lora`; `u` masked to the pinned genes, the `V`s on their own Adagrad at the LoRA+ rate |
| masked-* (`senna/src/masked_topic.rs`, `candle-util/src/frozen_features.rs`) | `Var "enc.feature.embeddings"`; `overwrite_var_2d`, `trainable_vars` | name excluded from AdamW | compose `ρ₀ (detached) + U·V`; U, V Vars; two AdamW groups (λ) |
| fne / simba (`graph-embedding-util/src/fne/`) | `model.e` Var; `PresetRows`; gradient mask before `RowAdagrad::step` | zeroed gradient ⇒ zero step | same composition; U rows on RowAdagrad, V on its own |
| `pinto cage` (`graph-embedding-util/src/model/mod.rs`, `pinto/src/cell_activity_graph_embedding/`) | `JointEmbedModel`: free `e_feat` Var, or `FeatAdapter` (`rho` const `[D, h_src]`, `w` Var `[h_src, H]`, optional full-width residual), or `FeatModules`; one `ComposedFeat` seam for the gather, the materialize and the ridge | `--gene-embedding-mode freeze`: post-step restore of the matched rows | `--gene-embedding-mode lora` (landed 2026-09-17): `FeatLora`, the third `ComposedFeat` — the freeze arm's pinned `e_feat` plus a `PinnedLora` whose `u` is masked to the matched genes inside the composition, `v` on its own AdamW group at the LoRA+ rate, the Gram ridge at `--lora-ridge` per step; the knobs are the shared `LoraArgs` group. The adapter (`K_text · W₀ + residual`) stays the width-changing path |

Also in place: `gene-text` (`qc`, `knn-graph`; `{out}.text_embedding.parquet`, feature→word and text-kNN edge files, `feature_types.parquet`); the typed `senna fne` engine (PPI + derived SNN/PPR relations, `--edges`, GO/GMT memberships, `{out}.feature_embedding.parquet` with all node types); the shared `FeatureEmbeddingArgs` (senna) over the shared `graph_embedding_util::LoraArgs` knob group (senna and pinto) and `feature_preset::load_preset_genes`; `--embedding-dim auto` (`graph_embedding_util::EmbeddingDim`, senna and pinto); `annotate-by-{projection,enrichment}` with bootstrap + permutation; `--poisson-thin`; `CellEncoders` (post PR #58) as the query trunk.

**Gaps, in build order** (1, 2 and 4 landed 2026-09-16 on branch `ypp/feature-lora`: `graph_embedding_util::PresetMode`, the three flags, `candle_util::lora` with the `FeatureEmbedding::Lora` variant and the LoRA+ optimizer group, LoRA on fne/simba; the masked checkpoint folds the residual into the table before saving, so `predict` reads a plain table.)
1. ~~`--lora-feature-embedding`, `--lora-rank`, `--lora-lr-ratio` on the shared struct; `resolve()` returns `PresetMode::{Init, Freeze, Lora{rank, lr_ratio}}`.~~
2. ~~LoRA composition in masked-* (candle Vars, two AdamW groups).~~
3. ~~Phase 1 of bge on candle, then LoRA on bge.~~ Landed with the port (2026-09-17): the partition, unit table and step plan stay host indexing (ids only); a track's gene-level groups are bucketed by member count and padded into one batched matmul, so a step is a few dozen kernels whatever the module count; parity is an independent f64 reference of the module docs' formula plus autograd-vs-finite-difference on every table. The module-level residual `μ_m = μ₀_m + a_m·V_M` is in as well, at the same rank as the gene residual, so a correction splits into "this module shifted" and "this gene shifted within it" — the split phase 1 already assumes.
4. ~~Same in fne/simba.~~
5. Resolver accepts `{prefix}.text_embedding.parquet`; when the table's width ≠ H, route through `FeatAdapter` (candle engines) or refuse with a message pointing at the offline projection (hier).
6. `b_g` in masked-topic (arrives with 2, not separately).
7. Unmatched genes → free rows in the masked loader (today they are dropped).

## 7. The probe (before any model code)

All steps in R (vignette convention) or the thin Rust binary; a single-run difference proves nothing on this codebase, so three seeds throughout.

1. **Tables → parquet.** Our own `senna fne` table (GO + PPI + words, H = 128, needs no projection) first; then BioConceptVec (PubMed word2vec/fastText — the literal "trained on PubMed" table), GenePT / scGenePT (NCBI, UniProt, GO text), the 2026 open-backbone GenePT release, scELMo. Align to the run's gene axis, report coverage, centre + whiten, PCA to H, pre-fill unmatched genes with the run's own init so nothing is dropped. Write `{prefix}.feature_embedding.parquet`.
2. **Residual diagnostic on existing runs (no training).** Regress a trained bge ρ and a masked-topic ρ on each `K_text`: R², residual singular spectrum (→ the rank), and *which* genes are explained — expect a literature-attention bias (famous genes explained, obscure ones not); this decides whether the prior is about biology or fame.
3. **Three-arm A/B on `masked-topic` and `bge`** (all three modes exist on both; 100 epochs is enough to see whether an anchor helps, per the sim). **Measured on bge, BMMNC, GO+PPI fne anchor, 100 epochs, three seeds (2026-09-17):** cell-side silhouette over marker-derived lineages — freeze 0.204, init 0.170, lora rank 16 ratio 1 ridge 100: 0.321, ridge 1000: 0.317; lora wins on every seed, the two ridges tie, and ridge 1000 keeps the residual at 0.74× the anchor's norm (100: 1.7×). The ridge is now a weight per anchored row (a sum over rows, since the data gradient on the shared factor is one too), so 1000 over 19k pinned genes is the default 0.05 per row, the same number at any table size. Without the ridge the residual grew to 3–8× the anchor at every ratio and the lineages collapsed: the shared factor's summed gradient is consistent and the row optimizer's step is normalised, so it marches; the ridge is not optional on bge. Monocyte hold-out (train without them, predict them): every arm places them as one island; silhouette to the nearest training lineage init 0.44, lora ridge 100 0.39, plain 0.38, freeze 0.35 — this anchor does not decide the unseen-lineage question, a text-derived one might. Random vs `--init` vs `--freeze` vs `--lora` with r ∈ {4, 16, 64} and λ ∈ {1, 16}, per table. First data point already on record (FNE session, 2026-09-16): `bge --freeze-feature-embedding` on the GO + PPI fne table pinned 19k of 37k BMMNC genes and resolved *less* than plain bge (NK/CD8 island, platelets, tight T lost) — the expected "graph table is coarser than counts" outcome, and not a test of text or of LoRA. LoRA passes when it matches `init` on held-out LL / ARI while keeping gene-side AUC ≥ `freeze` and recovering the structure `freeze` lost. Two claims, measured separately: **convergence** (epochs to the random init's final ELBO) and **optimum** (held-out LL, gene-side AUC, topic coherence, ARI). Track `‖ρ_t − ρ₀‖/‖ρ₀‖` (and, under `lora`, the singular spectrum of `U·V`) — an init that is washed out in a few epochs has only tested convergence.
   - **3b. Projection revived, on BMMNC** (the adversarial bed). Type signatures both ways (marker mean through anchored ρ; type text through `W₀`); the existing permutation null; agreement with `annotate-by-enrichment` and trusted labels. Expect lineage agreement to jump and sibling agreement to stay flat.
   - **3c. Training-free vocabulary.** Name an existing run's topics by nearest concepts; on a dataset with a known state (IFN-stimulated or tumour-infiltrated), do `interferon response` / `exhaustion` surface for the right cells — the result a hierarchy cannot produce.
4. **CITE-seq ADT check.** Anchored ρ on the multiome run that collapsed: does the gene AUC recover with the ADT rows on their target-gene text.
5. **Branch.** Convergence only → `--init` stays, `--lora` goes (take-back rule). Quality → keep the rank and λ the sweep chose, drop `--lora-lr-ratio` if λ = 1 ties. Nothing → the idea is dead for the price of a day.

**Gene-side truth is expression-side** (held-out co-expression, STRING PPI, CITE-seq pairing) — never GO, which leaks from the text.

## 8. After the probe (order, with dependencies)

A. **Robustness benchmark** on current bge: Poisson-thin queries to 10–20 %, inject ambient at a few %, measure retrieved-label stability. The primary evaluation axis for everything below and an unpublished gap.
B. **Ontology levels** in phase 1 (backbone `is_a` path per term for distillation targets; rank-normalised CL cut; partial coverage per level is fine). Leave-one-term-out: a held-out `CD8⁺` cohort must stop at `T cell`, not become `CD4⁺` — under A's noise too.
C. **`annotate-by-retrieval` + agreement**: kNN vote over our own reference (impute core, IVF index) as one voter beside projection, enrichment, the scTOP-style pb-basis projection, and the ontology nodes; confidence = consensus count; OOD = distance *and* low agreement. Calibration curve; leave-one-type-out; BMMNC.
D. **Same LoRA primitive, second attachment**: query-side adapter on `CellEncoders` for batch (rank r regularises against absorbing biology; hold out a cell type and see whether it survives adaptation).
E. **Multiome**: anchored genes + free peak rows; enhancer–gene benchmark; prior handed to chickpea.
F. **Concept sets → hypothesis sentences**, with the template baseline as the control (a reader's ability to identify the cluster; fraction of proposed tests that turn out true).
G. **MCP server** over senna/pinto outputs — the tool layer the sentences' proposed tests run against; independent of A–F.

## 9. What would fool us

Fame not function (step 2); GO leakage (expression-side truth only); coverage — lncRNA and novel genes have no text, ADT rows use the target gene; hubness in text space (CSLS); siblings are text-blind by nature (depth axis handles them); PCA-to-H loses the prior (acceptable for the probe only); an init washed out by AdamW masquerading as "no effect"; single-seed A/Bs; and the multiome trap of reading co-placement as a cis link.

## 10. Decisions still open

1. Reference atlas for B/C: own labelled atlases (trusted labels, matched protocol) vs a Census subset (breadth, CL labels, mixed protocol) — D exists for the mismatch case.
2. Which existing run's ρ is the test bed for step 2 (BM1, panc8, the multiome run).
3. Whether `s_g` (DoRA scale) gets a flag before the probe. Recommendation: no — `b_g` first, `s_g` only if the ADT check (step 4) still fails.
