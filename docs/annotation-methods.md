# Marker-based cell-type annotation in `senna` — methods

What the method does and why each part of it is there. Every default quoted here is the shipped
default; every number attributed to "measured" was obtained on the dataset described in §7.
Code: `graph-embedding-util/src/type_annotation/{term_ora,marker_bootstrap,panel_null}.rs`,
driven by `senna annotate-gem` and `senna lineage --markers`.

---

## 1. Inputs and the space the call is made in

`senna gem` embeds cells and gene features jointly. Two of its outputs matter here:

| output | rows | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `{out}.cell_embedding.parquet` | cells × H | the latent cell coordinate **θ_c** |
| `{out}.feature_coembedding.parquet` | feature rows × H | the co-embedded gene vector **e_g** (ρ re-placed onto the cell manifold; the raw ρ is `{out}.feature_embedding.parquet`) |

Feature rows are keyed `{gene}/count/{spliced,unspliced}`; annotation selects one modality and
re-keys by gene (`spliced` is the base track every gene has; `unspliced`, when present, is its
ridge-shrunk offset track, contrasted against the base in `{out}.feature_contrast.parquet`).

**Annotation does not use the `β_g` dictionary**, and this is load-bearing. A Euclidean
nearest-centroid call is only meaningful if genes and cells inhabit one metric space. gem couples
β and θ through an *inner product*, which fixes their relative directions but not their relative
scale — and the fitted model exploits that freedom. Measured: β rows have median norm **0.00**
and mean norm 0.21, against cells at 30.1. (The measurement predates the always-on softmax gate,
where most genes were untrained and their post-hoc projection failed its null test; a
near-zero median β survives that change, since a gene with no cell-state signal now sends its
gate mass to the null slot and lands at β̃_g ≈ 0 instead.) At that ratio

    ‖θ − c‖² = ‖θ‖² − 2⟨θ, c⟩ + ‖c‖²

loses the ‖c‖² term, and ‖θ‖² is constant across candidate types, so `argmin` collapses to
`argmax ⟨θ, c⟩` — an unnormalized inner product in which a centroid's **norm** decides the winner
largely irrespective of its direction. Measured on an untrained panel, the rank correlation
between a type's centroid norm and the share of cells it captured was **+0.93**.

> **Prerequisite — the panel must be on the trained feature axis.** A marker that never entered
> the fit is not merely down-weighted, it is *absent* from `{out}.feature_coembedding.parquet`, and
> a type that entered with 20 markers and scores on 1 still produces a confident-looking call.
> Measured with a mismatched panel (44% of markers trained): spurious assignment to types absent
> from the tissue ran at 59.7%; with the matching panel (97% trained) it fell to **18.9%**.
>
> At gem's default `--n-hvg 0` this is satisfied by construction: every gene is trained and the
> per-gene softmax gate does the selecting, so no panel gene can miss the axis. The prerequisite
> bites only when you set `--n-hvg > 0` — there, pass `senna gem --markers <panel>` (or
> `--must-train-features <panel>`) with *the same marker file* the annotation will use, which
> force-trains the panel regardless of the HVG cut.
>
> Either way, report `n_live / n_markers` (in `{out}.panel_null.tsv`, or the "marker liveness" log
> line) as a QC figure — if it is not near 100%, nothing downstream is interpretable.

## 2. Type prototypes and the per-cell call

For a marker panel assigning genes to types, each type *T* gets an **IDF-weighted centroid**

    e_T = ( Σ_{g ∈ markers(T)} w_g · e_g ) / ( Σ_{g ∈ markers(T)} w_g )

over its **live** markers only (a gene with an all-zero embedding row contributes nothing and is
excluded from *both* numerator and denominator; counting it in the denominator would shrink the
centroid toward the origin in proportion to a type's dead-marker fraction, and a short centroid is
not a weak competitor but a *magnet*). `w_g` is the inverse-document-frequency weight
down-weighting markers shared across many types (`--no-idf` disables).

Cells are assigned by nearest centroid, `t(c) = argmin_T ‖θ_c − e_T‖₂`. Zero-norm centroids are
excluded from the competition: they sit at constant distance `‖θ_c‖` from every cell and would
otherwise capture every cell nearer the origin than to any real prototype.

**QC prune.** Within each type, cells whose distance to their assigned centroid is a high-side
robust outlier (`> median + k·MAD`, `k = --assign-mad`, default **2.5**) are set to `unassigned`:
they took a type by `argmin` but do not actually sit near it (ambient RNA, doublets).

---

## 3. Over-representation within cell groups

A single cell's nearest-centroid call is close to a coin flip; pooling makes it testable. Cells
are grouped by **Leiden** community detection on their cosine kNN graph (`--knn`, default 30;
`--resolution`, default 1.0 — see §8 for why a *low* resolution is required).

For each (group *K*, type *T*) the count `a = #{c ∈ K : t(c) = T}` is tested against the
hypergeometric null with margins `(N, m_T, n_K)`, where **N and m_T are counted over the cells**
(each cell once), *not* summed from the contingency table. The statistic is `S = −ln P(X ≥ a)`.

`S` is then **calibrated against a permutation null**: the per-cell labels are shuffled with the
group memberships held fixed, and `S` is pooled across groups within a type (the statistic is
relabeling-invariant). `--num-perm` (default 500) draws; the pool is `n_perm × n_groups`, capped
at 10⁵ per type. The permutation p is Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted across the types within each
group. A group is called by its top over-represented type if `q < --fdr-alpha` (default **0.1**),
else left uncalled; its cells inherit the call.

**The permutation and the hypergeometric are the same test.** Shuffling the cell labels with the
group memberships held fixed makes the count in (K, T) *exactly* Hypergeometric(N, m_T, n_K)
conditional on the margins — Fisher's argument — which is what the analytic form already computes.
Confirmed on every run: `median log10(p_perm / p_analytic) = 0.0000`. The permutation is therefore a
*self-consistency check*, not an independent test, and it is only run on the reported pass; the
bootstrap's replicates use the exact analytic p (which also has no `1/(pool+1)` floor).

Calibration diagnostics (`{out}.null_calibration.tsv`): analytic-vs-permutation agreement, and a
genomic-inflation-style λ plus a Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic on the permutation null itself. λ is
computed with **mid-p** tie-splitting, without which the discrete statistic's ties at the floor
pin λ at a constant 108.77 — an artifact of the numerical clamp, not inflation.

---

## 4. Stability bootstrap (default ON)

`argmin` always returns something, and returns it with no error bar. Two error sources are
therefore treated as zero: the **marker list can be wrong** (a listed gene is not specific to its
type in this dataset), and the **embedding can disagree with it** (a type's markers do not sit
together, so its centroid is a fiction).

Rather than posit a generative density, we resample the evidence. For each of `B` replicates
(`--n-boot`, default **200**):

1. **Resample the panel.** For each type, draw `|live(T)|` of its live markers *with replacement*
   and rebuild `e_T` from that multiset (Efron's bootstrap over the marker panel).
2. **Re-derive the grouping.** Re-run Leiden under a fresh seed (`senna annotate-gem`), or refit the
   k-means MST nodes under a fresh seed (`senna lineage`).
3. Re-run §2–3 end to end and record each cell's resulting label.

The shipped label is the consensus; `label_support` is the fraction of replicates that agreed.

Three points of method:

- **The bootstrap perturbs exactly the decision variable**, so the jitter it induces is
  automatically on the scale of the decision. Nothing needs calibrating against the
  (incommensurable) spread of the cells.
- **The grouping must be resampled too, or the bootstrap has no teeth.** Holding the partition
  fixed and resampling only the panel measures almost nothing: a 2,000-cell cluster's `argmax`
  does not flip because a few markers were redrawn. Measured with the partition held fixed: **0%**
  of cells abstained, and support's ability to separate spurious calls fell from **AUC 0.93 to
  0.69**. The partition is where the instability lives. (This is not an optional stochasticity:
  the kNN graph is built by `hnsw_rs`, which seeds itself from OS entropy with no API to set it,
  and Leiden amplifies a 0.3% edge difference — four identical runs of the same binary on the same
  15,315 cells produced **990 / 132 / 137 / 138** communities.)
- **The kNN graph is built once and only Leiden is reseeded.** The cell embedding is identical on
  every replicate — the bootstrap resamples the *panel*, not the cells — so rebuilding the graph
  would only re-randomise an approximate-nearest-neighbour index's internal seed, which is
  implementation noise, not uncertainty about the data. Measured: 135 s → 4 s, with support
  correlation 0.96 and AUC 0.931 → 0.943.

**`label_support` is not a posterior.** It is the sampling variability of the pipeline's own
output: it sees **variance, not bias**. A systematically wrong call that every replicate agrees on
returns support 1.0. That is what §5 is for.

A type with fewer than 2 live markers is excluded from the competition entirely: a one-element
panel resampled with replacement always returns itself, so its centroid never moves and it appears
*perfectly* stable — the opposite of the truth.

---

## 5. Set-valued ("mixed") annotation

Collapsing the replicate distribution to `argmax` + a threshold discards the information the
bootstrap exists to produce. We instead report, for every cell, the **smallest set of types whose
replicate shares sum to `--set-coverage`** (default **0.8**), rendered in canonical order and
capped at `--max-set-size` (default **3**):

    label_set = HSPC/LMPP        label_set_size = 2        label_set_support = 0.87

The set is taken over *types*, while the shares remain shares of *all* replicates — so any mass
the replicates spent on "no call" makes the coverage harder to reach, and a cell its replicates
mostly declined to call falls out as uncalled rather than being given the nonsense set
`Erythroid/unassigned`.

The cap is a test, not a truncation: a cell needing a 4th type to reach coverage is reported
`unassigned`, because past that point a set stops narrowing anything down and would launder "we
don't know" as a finding.

Measured (7 compartments, 200 replicates, matched panel): **38.0% single, 33.4% two-way, 28.3%
three-way, 0.3% no call**, mean `label_set_support` 0.93. Under a single-label rule the two- and
three-way cells would all have been reported as "unassigned".

**Abstention rule for the single-label column.** Default `--min-support` (0.5): the top type must
win at least that share. We note that this bar is *not* scale-free — with `C` types, chance
agreement is `1/C`, so 0.5 sits at 3× chance for a 6-type panel and 12× chance for a 24-type one,
and the same setting is a different test on different panels. `--abstain-separable` offers a
scale-free alternative: an exact binomial sign test of the top type against the runner-up (among
the `m` replicates choosing one of the two, `n₁ ~ Binomial(m, ½)` under equal probability). It
resolves more cells but does not improve correctness — an abstention rule decides *when to stay
silent*, never *whether a call is right*.

---

## 6. Marker-panel permutation null (bias guard, `--panel-perm`)

The bootstrap is blind to bias. The panel null asks the complementary question: *is this answer
better than one a panel that means nothing would have given?*

For each type *T* and each of `P` draws: replace **only** *T*'s panel with `|live(T)|` genes drawn
at random from the pool of *live* marker genes, keeping *T*'s IDF weight multiset, and leave every
rival type's panel real. Rebuild `e_T`, re-run the assignment, and score

    bar[c][T] = min_{S ≠ T} ‖θ_c − e_S‖²          (the rivals — real, and fixed)
    cost(T | panel) = Σ_c min( ‖θ_c − e_T(panel)‖², bar[c][T] )
    p_T = P( cost(T | random genes) ≤ cost(T | T's own genes) )

**The null draw is matched on gene norm** — and this is not a refinement, it decides the answer.
A type's centroid is the mean of its markers' embeddings, so a type whose markers are *long*
vectors gets a long centroid; and because `‖cell‖ ≫ ‖centroid‖` the Euclidean rule degenerates to
`argmax ⟨x, c⟩`, where a longer centroid wins cells almost irrespective of direction (measured:
rank correlation between centroid norm and cell share, **+0.93**). Draw the null genes *uniformly*
and every null panel inherits the pool's mean norm — so a type above that mean beats its null on
norm alone, and one below it loses on norm alone, with no biology tested either way.

This is GOseq's bias [16] in a different coordinate. GOseq stratifies on gene *length* because
length is the observable proxy for the thing that biases the test (reads → power). Our covariate is
the embedding norm itself, which we can measure directly — so we stratify on it exactly, and skip
the noncentral (Wallenius) approximation GOseq needs because it cannot permute.

The effect on the cord-blood panel is not subtle:

| | uniform draw | **norm-stratified** |
|---|---|---|
| `Spearman(mean gene norm, p)` | **−0.857** | **+0.107** |
| EoBasoMast | p = 0.020 ✓ | p = 0.515 |
| Granulo-Mono | p = 0.060 | p = 0.521 |
| Megakaryocyte | p = 0.119 | **p = 0.008** ✓ |
| Lymphoid | p = 0.075 | **p = 0.020** ✓ |

Unstratified, the p-value was almost a monotone function of mean gene norm. EoBasoMast's
"significance" was pure norm artifact; Megakaryocyte and Lymphoid were *masked* by it.

Four further design points, each of which we found to be necessary:

- **One type at a time.** Randomising every panel at once collapses all `C` null centroids onto
  the marker-pool mean; they become mutually indistinguishable and the null fails for reasons
  unrelated to any particular type. Holding the rivals real keeps the competition intact.
- **Same size ⇒ the winner's curse cancels.** A type with few live markers has a high-variance
  centroid, and a noisy prototype wins cells it should not (the maximum of a noisy score is biased
  upward). The null panel is drawn at the same size and is *equally* wobbly, so the advantage
  appears on both sides and divides out. A small panel is asked only whether *these* genes beat
  *any* genes.
- **Null genes are drawn from the live pool.** A random *untrained* gene carries no signal at all,
  so a null of dead genes would be trivially beatable and every type would look significant. This
  holds "is the gene trained?" fixed and isolates "are these the right genes?".
- **The statistic is assignment cost, not cell count.** Occupancy measures whether any rival is
  nearby, not whether the panel is right: on a cleanly separated synthetic panel a random draw
  captures *as many cells as the real one* (0.337 vs 0.333, p = 0.995), because once *T*'s real
  centroid leaves the competition its cells have no near rival and anything in the neighbourhood
  sweeps them up by elimination. Cost separates them; it also has no perverse optimum (a centroid
  capturing nothing pays the maximum `Σ bar`).

On a matched panel the null discriminates: the three compartments holding cells pass
(Erythroid p = 0.005, EoBasoMast p = 0.020, Granulo-Mono p = 0.060) and the four that do not, fail.
On a *mismatched* panel it finds nothing significant — which is itself the correct verdict.

---

## 6b. Support permutation null (`--support-perm`) — calibrating the cutoff

`label_support` is a raw agreement fraction, and the bar it is compared against (`--min-support`,
0.5) is arbitrary. Worse, it is **not scale-free**: with `C` types chance agreement is `1/C`, so 0.5
sits at 3× chance on a 6-type panel and 12× chance on a 24-type one — the same flag is a different
test on different panels, and their abstention rates are not comparable.

So calibrate it. Shuffle **which type each marker gene belongs to** — within norm strata, so no
type's norm profile changes (§6) — and re-run the whole bootstrap. That is the literal statement of
"the panel carries no information about cell type". Then

    p_i = P( support under a meaningless panel ≥ support observed )

with Benjamini–Hochberg across the cells, giving `support_q`. **A cutoff on an FDR means the same
thing whatever the number of types.**

Three points of method:

- **The null must use the same `B`.** `s_i = max_t n_it/B` is a maximum over noisy proportions and
  is biased upward, the more so the smaller `B` is; matching `B` makes that bias appear on both
  sides and cancel. There is no closed form and no CLT shortcut — a maximum is an extreme-value
  statistic, not an asymptotically normal one, and the variance that matters is *across shuffled
  panels*, not across replicates.
- **The null cannot be pooled across cells.** A cell deep inside a dense cluster gets high support
  under *any* panel, because it is stably assigned to whichever centroid is nearest. Pooling would
  hand it a small p for a reason that has nothing to do with markers.
- **It is affordable because the partitions do not depend on the panel.** The `B` Leiden partitions
  are drawn once and reused by the observed run *and* every shuffle, so `P × B` re-clusterings
  collapse to `B`. (It also holds partition variability fixed between observed and null.)

**The headline number, and the reason this matters:** on cord blood a *shuffled* panel still earns a
mean support of **0.60**. The default bar of 0.50 therefore sits **below the null** — it was keeping
91% of cells, including many whose agreement was *worse than chance*. The calibrated cutoff keeps
36%.

## 7. Validation design

**Negative control without ground truth.** The BoneMarrowMap broad panel contains 10 mature /
terminal types that cord blood does not contain (they are `#`-commented out of the shipped panel
for exactly this reason). Re-enabling them turns every cell they capture into a *countable false
positive*, needing no labels. Reported as "mature share".

**Support calibration.** Bin cells by `label_support` and measure agreement with the point-estimate
label. Measured: support ≥ 0.8 → 96.2% agreement; support < 0.6 → 54.5%. As a detector of spurious
(mature) calls, support reached **AUC 0.83** with no ground truth.

**Headline.** Cord blood, 15,315 cells, 24-type panel: mature share 28.2% (point estimate) →
**2.4%** (bootstrap). Independently, on the panel-vs-embedding axis: 59.7% (44% of the panel
trained) → **18.9%** (97% trained).

---

## 8. Negative results (do not re-derive)

**Clustering-free / per-cell-neighbourhood ORA fails.** Replacing the Leiden partition with one
kNN neighbourhood per cell (the Milo device) was **worse than the untested `argmin`** — 38.1% vs
28.2% spurious — and manufactured cells for types with 4 in the entire dataset. Over-representation
ranks types by how **surprising** a count is, not how **likely**: a discovery statistic, not a
classifier. The two rankings coincide only when the group is large (in a 700-cell cluster you need
many cells to be surprising, so most-enriched ≈ most-abundant); in a 43-cell ball it inverts. The
pooling must stay coarse, and Milo's precedent does not transfer because *its* labels
(condition, sample) are external to the embedding whereas ours are `argmin` in the same space that
defines the neighbourhoods. Full write-up and tables: [`annotation-grouping.md`](annotation-grouping.md).

**Parametric Bayesian centroids fail.** A conjugate Gibbs sampler with the centroid as a latent
(`μ_T ~ N(m_T, (ω_T²/κ_T)·I)`) passed every synthetic control and then made the real negative
control *worse* (48% mature vs 28% baseline): the free per-type variance let one component
shrink-wrap a blob and take 33% of cells at entropy 0.005. Misspecification surfaces as false
confidence, not as uncertainty.

**High Leiden resolution is a bad operating point.** Over 50 replicates:

| resolution | communities | cells labelled | mean support |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0.5** | **30–36** | 86.3% | **0.83** |
| 1.0 | 41–48 | 86.1% | 0.80 |
| 2.0 | 62–68 | 79.2% | 0.77 |
| 8.0 | 128–1713 | 73.8% | 0.74 |

| output | contents |
|---|---|
| `{out}.annot.parquet` | per cell: `coarse_label`, `label_set`, `label_set_size`, `label_set_support`, `label_support`, `label_entropy`, `fine_label`, `fine_distance`, `cluster_size`, `community` |
| `{out}.label_stability.parquet` | per cell × type: the full replicate distribution |

| `{out}.null_calibration.tsv` | permutation-null diagnostics (λ, KS, analytic agreement) |

`senna lineage --markers` runs the same core over the trajectory's MST nodes instead of Leiden
communities (the bootstrap's regroup step reseeds the k-means), writing `{out}.lineage_annot.*`
and `{out}.trajectory_annotation.parquet` (node → role → cell type → confidence). With the
bootstrap on, that `confidence` is the mean bootstrap support of the cells that voted for the
node's label — a reproducibility — rather than a softmaxed test statistic. This matters because
`--root-type` selects the trajectory root as the highest-confidence node of a named type, so the
entire trajectory hangs off that number.
